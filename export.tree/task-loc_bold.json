    "TaskDescription": "Subjects performed a visual localizer task. Stimuli were presented in miniblocks at a rate of 4 HZ. Subjects were instructed to maintain fixation on a central cross and to respond to oddball frames in which a blank display, rather than a face/object/place/character was presented. Due to an error, these responses were not recorded."
